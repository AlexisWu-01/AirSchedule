# Breakdown:
1. **Senario**: A user viewing a list of flight results and selects flight "AS 3478" and asks, "Can I make it to my apple meeting if I take this flight?"
2. **Objective**: The system should generate an interface that provides accurate information to answer the user's question by orchestrating backend APIs and frontend UI elements.
3. **Goals**:
   - High Flexibility: The system should be adaptable for other general genUI elements.
   - Minimized Latency: The system should be able to respond to user queries in real-time.
   - High Accuracy: The system should provide accurate information to the user.
# Approach
1. User Interaction Flow:
   1. Starting Screen: Display a list of flight results.
   2. User Action: The user selects flight "AS 3478" and asks their question.
   3. System Response: Injects relevant information below the flight card to answer the user's query.

2. Understanding the user's intent:
   1. Utilize LLMService to parse the user's question and extract intent and entities.
   2. Identify that the user wants to know if the flight arrival time allows them to attend their apple meeting on time.
   

3. Backend Orchestration:
   1. Services and APIs:
      - FlightService: To get flight arrival time, airport, and delay information.
      - CalendarService: To get the meeting's start time and location.
      - MapsService: To calculate travel time from the airport to the meeting location.
      - WeatherService: To get weather information for the destination.
      - ClothingAdviceService: To provide clothing recommendations based on weather and event type.
   
   2. Action Planning and Execution:
      - Use LLMService to generate an ActionPlan based on the user's intent.
      - ActionExecutor processes the ActionPlan, calling appropriate services sequentially.
      - Context is updated after each action, ensuring data consistency.

4. Frontend UI:
   1. UI Components:
      - FlightDetailView: Displays selected flight information.
      - DynamicUIRenderer: Renders UI components based on the ActionPlan results.
      - Specific components like MeetingAvailabilityView, WeatherView, and MapView.
   
   2. Design Considerations:
      - Responsiveness: Information is displayed promptly for a good user experience.
      - Clarity: Clear and concise language conveys information effectively.
      - Visual Feedback: Immediate visual cues keep the user engaged and informed.

5. Data Flow:
   1. User query is processed by LLMService to generate an ActionPlan.
   2. ActionExecutor processes the plan, calling necessary services.
   3. Results are aggregated and passed to the UI for rendering.
   4. DynamicUIRenderer creates and updates UI components based on the data.

6. Error Handling and Edge Cases:
   - Implement robust error handling in services and UI components.
   - Consider scenarios like unavailable data, API failures, or unexpected user queries.

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
   - Optimize API calls to minimize latency and improve response times.

8. Future Enhancements:
   - Implement user preferences and history for more personalized responses.
   - Expand the range of supported queries and intents.
   - Integrate with more external services for comprehensive travel assistance.
