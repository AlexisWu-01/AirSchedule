# Breakdown:
1. **Senario**: A user viewing a list of flight results and selects flight "AS 3478" and asks, "Can I make it to my apple meeting if I take this flight?"
2. **Objective**: The system should generate an interface that provides accurate information to answer the user's question by orchestrating backend APIs and frontend UI elements.
3. **Goals**:
   - High Flexibility: The system should be adaptable for other general genUI elements.
   - Minimized Latency: The system should be able to respond to user queries in real-time.
   - High Accuracy: The system should provide accurate information to the user.
# Approach
1. User Interaction Flow:
   1. Starting Screen: Display a lit of flight results.
   2. User Action: THe user selects flight "AS 3478" and asks their question.
   3. System Response: Injects relevant information below the flight card to answer the user's query.
2. Understanding the user's intent:
   1. Utilize an LLM to parse the user's question and extract intent and entities (e.g. flight number, meeting details, etc)
   2. Identify that user wants to know if the flight arrival time allows them to attend their apple meeting on time.

3. **Backend Orchestration**:
   1. APIs/ Tools Needed:
      1. Flight information API: To get flight arrival time, airport, and delay information.
      2. Calendar API: To get the meeting's start time and location.
      3. Maps API: To calculate travel time from the airport to the meeting location.
  
   2. LLM capabilities:
      1. Orchestrate API calls based on the parsed  user intent.
      2. Handle data aggregation and logic to determine if the user can make it to the meeting.

4. **Frontend UI**:
  1. UI Elements:
     1. Flight details card: Displays selectedflight information.
     2. Meeting Information Section: Shows meeting time and location.
     3. Travel Time Estimate: Indicates the time it will take to get from the airport to the meeting location.
     4. Visual Indicators: Use icons or color coding to quickly convey whether the flight will allow the user to make it to their meeting on time.
  2. Design Considerations:
     1. Responsiveness: Information should be displayed promptly to maintain a good user experience.
     2. Clarity: Use clear and concise language to convey information.
     3. Visual Feedback: Provide immediate visual feedback to the user, such as loading indicators or color changes, to keep them engaged and informed.
