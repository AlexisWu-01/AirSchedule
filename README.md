5. **Build and Run**
   - Select the appropriate simulator or connect your device.
   - Click the **Run** button in Xcode to build and launch the application.

## Usage

1. **View Flights**
   - Upon launching the app, you'll see a list of available flights.
   - Select a flight (e.g., "AS 3478") to view detailed information.

2. **Ask Questions**
   - In the flight detail view, locate the input field labeled "Ask about your flight."
   - Enter your query, such as "Can I make it to my apple meeting if I take this flight?" and submit.
   
3. **Receive Responses**
   - The app will process your query, orchestrate necessary backend API calls, and display the relevant information below the flight details.
   - This may include meeting availability, travel time, weather forecasts, maps, and clothing advice based on current conditions.

## Architecture Overview

AirSchedule employs a modular and scalable architecture, ensuring flexibility, high performance, and ease of maintenance. The system is divided into frontend and backend orchestration layers, with each layer handling specific responsibilities.

### Key Components

#### **Frontend**

- **SwiftUI Views**
  - **FlightListView**: Displays a list of available flights.
  - **FlightDetailView**: Shows detailed information about a selected flight and handles user queries.
  - **DynamicUIRenderer**: Renders UI components dynamically based on the action plans generated by the backend.

- **ViewModels**
  - **FlightDetailViewModel**: Manages the state and logic for the `FlightDetailView`, including processing user queries and updating UI components.

#### **Backend Orchestration**

- **Services**
  - **LLMService**: Interfaces with the OpenAI API to parse user queries and generate actionable plans as well as uiComponents.
  - **ActionExecutor**: Executes the steps outlined in the action plans by interacting with various backend services.
  - **FlightService**: Retrieves flight details, statuses, and calculates travel times. Using real-time google flights api through serp api.
  - **CalendarService**: Manages user schedules and retrieves meeting details. Using apple Calendar EventKit.
  - **MapsService**: Calculates travel time and provides navigation data. Using apple MapKit.
  - **WeatherService**: Fetches current and forecasted weather information for specified locations. Using mock api.
  - **ClothingAdviceService**: Provides clothing recommendations based on weather conditions and event types. Using mock api.
  - **ResponseGenerationService**: Formats responses and UI components based on aggregated data.

- **Models**
  - **ActionPlan**: Represents the plan of actions derived from user queries, including intents, entities, actions, and UI components.
  - **Action**: Defines individual actions to be executed, specifying the API, method, and parameters.
  - **UIComponent**: Represents UI elements to be rendered, such as text, maps, and images.
  - **Flight**: Contains detailed information about a specific flight.

- **Error Handling**
  - Comprehensive error handling mechanisms ensure that the application can gracefully handle API failures, data inconsistencies, and unexpected user inputs, providing meaningful feedback to users.

#### **Workflow**

1. **User Interaction**
   - Users interact with the frontend by selecting flights and submitting queries.

2. **Intent Recognition**
   - The `LLMService` processes user queries using the OpenAI API to extract intents and entities, generating an `ActionPlan`.

3. **Action Execution**
   - The `ActionExecutor` sequentially performs the actions defined in the `ActionPlan`, interacting with various backend services to retrieve and process necessary data.

4. **UI Rendering**
   - The `DynamicUIRenderer` updates the UI based on the results of the executed actions, providing users with the requested information in a clear and organized manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift & SwiftUI**: Primary language and framework for building the application's frontend.
- **Combine**: Manages asynchronous events and data flows within the app.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of the app.
- **Foundation Framework**: Provides essential data types, collections, and operating-system services.
- **MapKit**: Integrates mapping and navigation features.
- **AnyCodable**: Allows for flexible decoding of JSON data with unknown structures.
